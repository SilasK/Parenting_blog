## Our First Birth

<!-- Some more introduction-->

One evening of a long weekend, we had just done some extra shopping^[
    I don't know if my wife intuitively knew the baby was coming,
    or if having everything ready allowed her to relax and contractions to start.
],
contractions began to kick in.
We counted the interval which was already 5 minutes.
"It's already very regular!", I thought, "Is the baby coming soon?"
-- If only we had known it would last more than 24 hours.

I thought that to prepare well for birth, I should know everything about the stages,
what happens and when, and that I needed to recognize the frequency of contractions.
In the end, it's not that important.
Yes, there are three different stages of birth^[
    Cervix dilation, baby's descent through the vagina, then delivery of the placenta
    ],
but ultimately, we spend most time in the first stage.
Better to accept it's going to take long and prepare for a marathon.

In the end, the contractions weren't so intense so we decided to try to sleep.
Which worked very well until two in the morning.
That's when the contractions started becoming too intense for my wife.

She would often get on all fours and make deep sounds^[
    Deep sounds can really help during birth, even if you lose your voice for a few days afterward.
],
as this made the pain most bearable, she explained to me.
She found that contractions hurt, really hurt, but the pain never became unbearable even though the intensity of contractions increased strongly during birth.

Even if contractions are intense and regular, we wait until the cervix is already somewhat dilated before going to the maternity ward or birth center.
We were really lucky to have midwives who came to our home for checkups.
But they kept telling us: "It's not time yet..., you need to wait more..., it's not time yet."

I don't know if all first births last this long, but this first phase seemed like an eternity
and there seemed to be no progress.

My wife wanted to take a hot bath to slow down the contractions and rest better.
Except the contractions didn't stop for long.
I still remember: I held her head while she sat in the bathtub, so she could doze between each contraction.

The worst part was, my wife could barely eat anything.
She threw up lunch, snacks wouldn't stay down either.
In a way, it makes sense, the body has no energy to spare for digestion.
So my wife ran a marathon without eating much!
(For subsequent births, we prepared with grape sugar and syrup
-- easily digestible energy.)

We hadn't planned for a home birth, but in the end we did almost half the labor at home.
And with all the pillows, mattresses in the living room and all the food and drinks my wife tried to consume during labor, I was quite happy to be able to ask my mother-in-law if she wouldn't mind coming back the day after the birth to see the baby and help us clean up.
