## Physiological Birth

My wife and I are convinced of physiological birth,
meaning a birth without cesarean section, without synthetic hormones, and without epidural.
Obviously, there are cases where interventions are necessary and life-saving.
Thank God for modern obstetrics!
But most often, childbirth is a natural process that doesn't require intervention.
In what follows, I would like to explain the reasons and experiences that convinced us.
We had our first and second births in a birthing center and a third one in the hospital,
which allows us to compare both.
I hope you can benefit from our experiences.

Before giving it more thought, we wondered "why not use the epidural?".
In general, medicine isn't in favor of women, so why not use one of the few treatments that explicitly helps women?
The pain during childbirth is so significant that trying to relieve it is a good thing, isn't it?

Our understanding changed when we spoke with a mother who had given birth to two children and who explained to us that with the epidural also comes the use of synthetic hormones. Why?
Pain, although we would like to avoid it, has a key function in the dynamics of childbirth.
The uterine contractions, even if involuntary, are still regulated by the body.
And pain is an important sensor for the body to know how to regulate contractions.

If all goes well, the mother's body produces oxytocin in response to pain^[
    The body also produces endorphins to reduce pain] - which promotes contractions.
If something goes wrong, for example if the baby is poorly engaged in the pelvis,
the body can feel it.
It can try to move the baby back up, for instance by inducing vomiting^[
    Vomiting during childbirth is therefore a good sign!
].

If we now stop the pain with the epidural,
we break the dynamics of childbirth.
We must add synthetic hormones to stimulate contractions.
We can dose them more or less and thus manage the intensity of contractions, but ultimately this has nothing to do with the physiological dynamics of childbirth.

As a side note, I find it interesting that, according to the Bible, even in a perfect world like paradise, childbirth was already described as a painful experience.

### Birth in the Hospital or in the Birth Center

After deciding to have a birth without epidural,
we really wanted to seek support that could encourage us in this direction.
That's why we wanted to give birth in a birth center.
At the time, the house or rather the birth room was in a hospital,
which reassured us for the worst case scenario^[
    Since we would have to go to the hospital emergency anyway in case of complications, I'm not sure if it's really faster if the birth center is in the hospital or just, as is often the case, next to the hospital.
].

We were almost too late to register at the birth center, but we were lucky to find a great midwife^[
    For those who live in our region.
    She will soon open a birth center in Corsier.
].
She was with us before birth, during birth, and after birth,
which creates quite a special bond.
A lady who was important at key moments in our family life.
She was already very experienced: she had children herself and had worked for several years in the hospital.

This wasn't just an advantage, she admitted to us, because when she started doing deliveries in birth centers,
she had to unlearn several mechanisms to really go at the mother's and baby's pace.
Hospital protocols are implemented so that a doctor who hasn't seen the mother can make an informed decision,
whereas in the birth center, the midwife is in the same room throughout the birth.
She knows how the mother is doing and is attentive to the first signs of complications.
In the hospital, they prepare for all complications that might occur.
But in the birth center, they believe in the mother.
They believe that her body knows best how to position itself, etc.

I think it's important to find a midwife who makes us feel confident and with
whom we are on the same wavelength, because there are all kinds.

The midwives at the birth center we chose were ready to come every day, at any time, during the term period.
Our midwife even drove us to the birth center.
I understand that this isn't necessarily possible everywhere.
Sometimes, it's a group of midwives who share the deliveries in the birth center.
So we know somewhat what kind of midwives might accompany us, even if we don't know exactly who we'll get.
In any case, I find it makes a big difference if we know the midwife who will accompany us during birth.
For our third child, we had the birth at the hospital where the midwives on duty tried to get to know us during the first contractions -- not the best time for small talk.

Finally, I would like to add that there are of course also more complicated births such as with twins or when the baby is breech.
In these cases, it's better to be closer to an operating room, but that doesn't mean a physiological birth is excluded.
