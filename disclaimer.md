I wanted to write this blog together with my wife about our experience as parents starting with pregnancy. 
With now three children we have something of experience which, which I wanted to share with you.
Personally I like reading blogs from others and reading about their own experience.


I wanted to write this blog mainly because I want to help others.

As pregnancy and parenting it is quite a delicate topic a statement of "We made it this way" can easily be interpreted as "This is the right way to do it" or even "You are a bad parent, if you don't do it this way".


It should really be what we experienced and what we learned through our journey.
