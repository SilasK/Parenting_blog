# Our paternity blog



## English

I wanted to write this blog together with my wife about our experience as parents starting with pregnancy. 
With now three children we have something of experience which, which I wanted to share with you.

Personally I like reading blogs from others and reading about their experience.
But I also know that pregnancy and parenting is quite a delicate topic.
And a statement of "We made it this way" can easily be interpreted as "This is the right way to do it" or even "You are a bad parent, if you don't do it this way".
Therefore this disclaimer. 
It should really be what we experienced and what we learned through our journey.
And we hope it might be useful.
